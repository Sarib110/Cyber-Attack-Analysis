# Cyber-Attack-Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis and classification of cyber attack data using various machine learning models. The goal is to accurately predict the type of cyber attack based on network data and other relevant features. The project uses a comprehensive dataset of cyber attacks and applies different preprocessing techniques, followed by the implementation of several machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The project reads and processes a large dataset of cyber attack records, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Implementation**: Multiple machine learning models are implemented, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and a neural network using Keras.
- **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their performance.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras
```

Happy Codding!
